Hi. I'm Dario.

I'm currently a final year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at Imperial College London, expected a graduation with a 1. While satisfying my passion for Data Analysis and Signals and Communications within the course, I pursuit my other interests through participation in various projects and societies of the college.

My passion for the disruptive nature of technology goes hand in hand with my strong leadership skills. This gives me the ability to analytically tackle and solve large problems; a skill which I have been able to develop through my roles and through my working experience. As such, delivering excellent strategies is core to my approach.

With self taught experience as a full stack developer, I currently lead the technical development of Imperial College Finance Society. I enjoy playing with new frameworks and languages, but tend to prefer working on Data Analysis/Analytics and JavaScript development. I have relevant experience in Matlab, C++, C#, Python, Go, Ruby, as well as with MongoDB, Redis and Cassandra.

Outside my commitments, I channel energy into running and swimming to hold a healthy work-life balance. I enjoy traveling and I continually try to practice my languages.
