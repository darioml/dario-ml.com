On the first of July 2013, I started my summer internship at [Hailo](http://www.hailocab.com). Hailocab is a startup which came-to-be in 2010. The purpose of the company is to disrupt the cab-hailing industy, and connect driver and passenger (Like Uber, but for real taxis). Today, it's not much of a startup anymore, although much of the development proccess is still very startup-esque.

Working was great. I really enjoyed the work, the hours, the people and the location. The connections I made, and the amount of leads I was exposed to was incredible. It was always the plan to leave after three months. Yet, as any other somewhat-capable intern, my leaving was questioned.

"Why are you studying? What difference does it make? Leave college, and come work with us - that's what Zuckerberg did!"

Short Answer: _No, thanks._

Long Answer: Thinking about it, I understand why it would be suggested. Working in tech rarely requires a degree. At any software shop I've worked, there have always only been a handful of people with a degree. Even those with a degree, rarely was it a computer science degree. __You don't really need a degree as a software engineer - you need experience__.

So why am I still studying? There are really two main reasons.

First off, "the system" works for me. I get good grades, study at a good college, and my parents have supported me through my education. Quitting now and leaving with nothing, would be selfish and wasteful.

Furthermore, I'm still young. Today, I might be good at software. Say I want to work for in specialised company, or even start my own company a few years down the line. Without an education to back me up, I'd have to learn on the job. And that's expensive, slow, and painful (not to mention uncompetitive).

Secondly, and probably more rational, leaving college throws me into the real world. I have half the schedualed hours as a job and can spare time and energy to do any projects I want. And whatever you do can fail without any punishment. Being where I am, I feel college _is a sandbox for entrepreneurship_.

College is great. If you like it, don't leave it for a company. You have your whole life ahead of you - spend your time to play around and decide what you want to do.
