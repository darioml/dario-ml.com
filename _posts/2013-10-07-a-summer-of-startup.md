On the first of July 2013, I started my summer internship at [Hailo](http://www.hailocab.com). Hailocab is a startup which came-to-be in 2010. The purpose of the company is to disrupt the cab-hailing industy, and connect driver and passenger (Like Uber, but for real taxis). Today, it's not much of a startup anymore, although much of the development proccess is still very startup-esque.

Working was great. I really enjoyed the work, the hours, the people and the location. The connections I made, and the amount of leads I was exposed to was incredible. It was always the plan to leave after three months, yes, as any other somewhat-capable intern, my education was often questioned.

"Why are you studying? What difference does it make? Leave college, and come work with us - that's what Zuckerberg did!"

Short Answer: _No, thanks._

Long Answer: Thinking about it, I understand why it would be suggested. Working in tech rarely requires a degree. At Hailo, there were only a handful of people with a computer science degree. The rest ranging from PhD to not even passing high school. __You don't need a degree as a software engineer - you need experience__.

So why am I still studying? There are really two main reasons.

First off, I have grown up and do well in "the system". I get good grades, study at a good college, my parents support me through my education, and have put a lot of their energy to get me this far. Quitting now, leaving with nothing, would be selfish and wasteful.

Furthermore, I'm still young ~ today, I might be good at software. Say you want to work for a specialised company, or even start your own company a few years down the line. Without an education to back you up, you learn on the job. And that's expensive, slow, and painful. Expensive, as your mistakes seriously affect your business/job; whether you succeed or not. Slow, as you only encounter problems as they come (and only one at at a time, without an ordering to them); a course on the other hand has a structure to teaching you many of these common pitfals. Painful, because you're literally reinventing the wheel.

Secondly, why would I leave the shelter of a college, where I have half the schedualed hours as a job and have the time to do any projects I want without any hesitation or judgement? After your 2-5 hours of lectures a day, your time can be filled with whatever you want. And whatever you do can fail without any implication. If you're at the right college, _it's a sandbox for entrepreneurship_.

College is great. If you like it, don't leave it for a company. You have your whole life ahead of you.
